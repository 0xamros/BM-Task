## Introduction

This repository contains my solution to the DevOps Engineer hiring challenge. The task involves dockerizing a Spring Boot application and implementing a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline to deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster. This README provides an overview of my approach, implementation details, and instructions for running the solution.

## Challenge Overview

The main objectives of this challenge were to:
1. Dockerize a provided Spring Boot application
2. Implement a CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps (or an alternative tool)
3. Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster
4. Create an Ingress for the application
5. Implement separate deployments for development and production environments

## Solution Architecture

[Insert your architecture diagram here]

The solution architecture consists of the following components:
- Version Control: GitHub
- CI/CD Tool: Azure DevOps
- Container Registry: Azure Container Registry
- Kubernetes Cluster: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- Monitoring: Azure Monitor

## Implementation Details

### Dockerization
- Created a Dockerfile optimized for Spring Boot applications
- Implemented multi-stage builds to reduce image size and improve security

### CI/CD Pipeline
Implemented a comprehensive pipeline in Azure DevOps with the following stages:
1. Lint Stage: Using CheckStyle for Java
2. Unit Test Stage: JUnit tests with code coverage reports
3. SonarQube Stage: Code quality and security analysis
4. Build Image Stage: Docker image creation
5. Push Image to Registry: Pushing to Azure Container Registry
6. Pull Image from Registry: Preparation for deployment
7. Deploy to Kubernetes: Using Helm charts for consistent deployments
8. Ingress Creation: Nginx Ingress Controller with SSL termination
9. Development Environment Deployment
10. Production Environment Deployment

### Kubernetes Deployment
- Created Helm charts for consistent application deployment
- Implemented namespace isolation for dev and prod environments
- Configured resource requests and limits for optimal performance
- Set up horizontal pod autoscaling for handling traffic spikes

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented in Azure DevOps using YAML. Key features include:
- Branch policies to enforce code review and build validation
- Environment-specific variable groups for secure configuration management
- Approval gates for production deployments
- Automated rollback mechanism in case of deployment failures

[Include a snippet or link to your pipeline YAML file]

## Kubernetes Deployment

Kubernetes manifests are managed using Helm charts. The chart structure includes:
- Deployments with configurable replicas and resource settings
- Services for internal communication
- Ingress resources for external access
- ConfigMaps and Secrets for environment-specific configurations

[Include a snippet or link to your Helm chart]

## Additional Features

- Implemented log aggregation using Azure Log Analytics
- Set up monitoring and alerting with Azure Monitor
- Created a `/live` endpoint for health checks and readiness probes

## Running the Solution

To run this solution locally or in your own environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone [Your Repository URL]
   cd [Repository Name]
   ```

2. Set up Azure DevOps and configure the pipeline:
   [Provide steps or link to detailed instructions]

3. Deploy to Kubernetes:
   [Provide steps or link to detailed instructions]

## Future Improvements

Given more time, I would enhance the solution with:
- Implement Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Add end-to-end testing in the pipeline
- Implement blue-green deployment strategy
- Set up a service mesh for advanced traffic management and security

## Conclusion

This solution demonstrates a robust, scalable, and secure approach to deploying a Spring Boot application on Kubernetes using modern DevOps practices. It showcases my skills in containerization, CI/CD implementation, Kubernetes deployment, and overall system architecture design.

I'm excited about the opportunity to discuss this solution in more detail and explore how my skills and experience align with your team's needs.
